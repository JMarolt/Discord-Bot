This discord bot was created to further practice with my coding skills and learning to read the Discord python API and practice python. Currently, it acts like the cases from Counter-Strike, where different items go by and some are rarer than the others. The items have values and can be sold(Currently trying to use scraping to get more accurte results). They also have their statistics stored. The bot also has other various functions such as joining a channel and playing sounds(still being worked on), sending messages, pinging people, and accessing and sharing gambling statistics.
